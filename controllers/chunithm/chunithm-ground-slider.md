## Basics

The ground slider requires a 12v power supply and communicates via serial. You can hook it up to a PC using pins 2, 3 and 5 on an RS232 cable. Your RS232 cable should be configured to communicate on port COM1. Please be aware of the below diagram for how to connect the board via usb.

## Pinout

There are four connectors on the slider. The ones we are concerned with are the second from left, and the rightmost connectors. These are the serial and power ports, respectively.
